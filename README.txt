Objective:
To see if roulette dealer has Dealer Signature/muscle memory when spinning the ball

Todo:
1.gather data

2.process data
-determine if the ball is within expected half of roulette wheel
	-determine EXPECTED DISTANCE
		-compare pocket between previous previous result and previous result
	-determine EXPECTED RESULT
		-calculate expected result by adding expected distance to previoust result
	-determine CORRECT HALF
		-determine what is correct half based on expected result
		-compare if actual result is within correct half
3.analyze data
	-determine if result is significantly more than half

Notes:
-take into account roulette dealer spin clockwise (CW) and anticlockwise (CW) in alternate.
-to take reference from previous same direction spin

Future todo:
-calculate different correct range (e.g. +8,+7,+6,+5,+4,+3,+2,+1)
